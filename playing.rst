How we play
############


Basics
=======

The test resolution mechanic is based on the CUE system developed by Catalyst
Game Labs, first for their Valiant Super Hero RPG and used modified later for
Shadowrun: Anarchy and Mechwarrior: Destiny. I wanted to keep things quick
and fun, while keeping a measure of randomness and uniqueness for each
character, so I chose the mechanics from Shadowrun: Anarchy as the basis for
our game:

   **Skill Dice + Attribute Dice + Modifiers (if any) +
   Shadow Amps effect (if any)** vs. **Opposing Dice**

.. admonition:: Glitches and Exploits

   The Glitch Die adds a bit more color to a test, where the GM or a player
   spends a Plot Point to use it in a roll. This die should be visibly
   different from the rest of the dice. If it comes up a 1, a glitch has
   occurred. An exploit happens when the Glitch Die comes up as a 5 or 6.
   Whether the overall roll was a success or failure for the action, a
   glitch adds an unexpected stroke of bad luck, whereas an exploit
   indicates a windfall of some kind.

The result is based on the number of hits, which is +1 for each die that has
rolled a five or six. Spending a point of Edge adds any die with a four, as
well. Use Edge wisely. As you can imagine this method uses a lot of 6 sided
dice. Difficulty level determines the number of opposing dice for a given test:

   :Very Easy: 4 dice
   :Easy: 6 dice
   :Average: 8 dice
   :Hard: 10 dice
   :Very Hard: 12 dice

All things being equal, the maximum natural level for an attribute for a
character is six (the limit for Human characters in Shadowrun: Anarchy).
